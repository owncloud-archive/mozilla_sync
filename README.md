Installation
------------
For install, re-/uninstall and upgrade instruction look at [Changing your Mozilla Sync installation](INSTALL.md).

Helpful hints
-------------

### Firefox on Android

Firefox on Android uses the ````RC4-SHA```` SSL cipher suite.
This must be enabled on your server in order for synchronization to work with Firefox on your smartphone or tablet.

If you use *nginx* you can add the following to your ````nginx.conf````:
````
ssl_ciphers HIGH:RC4-SHA:!aNULL:!MD5;
````

If you use *apache* you can add the following to your ````apache2.conf````:
````
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:RC4-SHA:!aNULL:!MD5
````

For more info see the [nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule#ssl_ciphers) and [apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslciphersuite) documentation.

Additionally, if you are using a self-signed SSL certificate you need to import it to Android via:
*Settings → Security → Install from storage*. Note that Android will only import self-signed certificates with the CA bit set.
The import was successful when you see your certificate in *Settings → Security → Trusted credentials*.

### LDAP
If you want to use Mozilla Sync with an LDAP backend, make sure that you enable email login. To do this set the LDAP user login filter in your admin panel to e.g. ```(|(uid=%uid)(mail=%uid))```.
